cucm2csv - Cisco Unified Communications Manager - Dial Plan Export Utility
   	 
cucm2csv is a tiny utility that allows to dump the dial plan report (phone directory) from CUCM in a CSV format. While the exact same function is available in the web interface, this utility can do it from the command line, batch or shell script, so that the current extension to person mapping can be captured and used in a CDR analysis, database or integration with Active Directory (eg to update the Outlook Address Book). The utility requires IP address and port of the CUCM server, AXL role enabled username and a file name to output to.
